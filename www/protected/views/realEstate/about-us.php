<h3><span id="ContentPlaceHolder1_lbl_title">About Us</span></h3>
<span id="ContentPlaceHolder1_span_aboutus"><p><strong>"Save Time and Money, Enjoy Life"</strong> Has been our
        philosophy since 1999 when we launched the first Chicago based For Sale By-Owner and Multiple Listing Service's
        where you could view FSBO and MLS listings on one website. Our notoriety didn't last long shortly thereafter, we
        started getting a lot of slack from Realtors complaining about the competition our site was giving them.
        Therefore we were asked to separate the two products. We immediately had to develop two separate sites to keep
        the for sale by-owner listings separate from the Multiple listing service listings.<strong> Yes, we now have a
            lot of competing FSBO websites today but NO ONE is offering to "Sell your Home for FREE"! </strong>

    <p>I am proud to say that our family has for six generations lived in the fabulous city of "Chicago". My
        great-grandparents survived the Chicago fire. Often dubbed Chicago's "original Gold Coast", the area known as the
        Prairie Avenue Historic District was once "the" place to live in Chicago. Having an address here meant that you were
        one of the most esteemed citizens of this marvelous city. My family roots are from this area of Chicago, and had a
        street named after our family "Cullerton". The Cullerton family has and continues to hold prominent positions in the
        City of Chicago, such as President of the United States Senate, Chicago Alderman, Cook county Assessor, City of
        Chicago sewer department, City of Chicago water department, Chicago Park District, and State political appointments
        such as President of the Senate. Our family members have also supported and attended some of our local Colleges such
        as the University of Chicago, DePaul, Loyola, and Northwestern University's. Giving back to Chicago is our primary
        goal, especially during these tough economical times. FSBONI is a family owned and operated Chicago business.
        We are proud of our new site which has been developed and will continue to be fine tuned to fit your needs in
        marketing your homes successfully and exclusively for Chicago and surrounding suburbs. Our motto is for our buyers
        and sellers to</p>
